# Introduction to Mydata
```{r}
setwd("C:\\Users\\Joseph Waldron\\OneDrive - kean.edu\\symester3\\big data\\codeBigData\\week9\\my_project_Competition_f22")
```
Information collected from various sources. Include images if possible.

Image of raw data: 
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="raw", out.width = '75%',fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("raw.png")
```

Image of codebook

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Codebook", out.width = '90%',fig.align = 'center'}

## Link to Data

Data webpage:  <https://nces.ed.gov/nhes/dataproducts.asp> 

## Questions/ Reasons 

Identify few questions about your data that you would like to address. 
Reasons that motivated you to select your data. 


# Packages

List and Load all packages that will be used in your project and include one line comment explaining the nature of the list.
For example: (dplyr: to wrangle and manipulate data)

```{r}
#library(dplyr) #this package is used for data manipulation
#library(maps) # this package to draw maps
#library(knitr)
```

# reading the data

include a chunk to read the data and names
```{r}
rd <- read.csv("2022 Fall Data Challenge Dataset.xlsx - curated 2019-required.csv")
```

# Data Wrangling

Clean and label and prepare your data
Show the size of the data
numbers of rows and columns
classes of columns, how many `NA`?
Print out few lines
Rename variables of interest if their original name is long
Any substetting?
