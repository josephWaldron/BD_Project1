# Introduction to Mydata

rd= read.csv("C:/Users/LiamL/Downloads/2022 Fall Data Challenge Dataset.xlsx - curated 2019-required.csv")

Information collected from various sources. Include images if possible.

Example: 
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Boxplot Diagram", out.width = '75%',fig.align = 'center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("boxplot_scheme.png")
```

another example using snipe

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Snipe Example", out.width = '90%',fig.align = 'center'}
#knitr::include_graphics("snipe_example.png")
```

## Link to your data

Data webpage:  <https://nces.ed.gov/nhes/dataproducts.asp> 

Project PowerBall Webpage : 
## Questions/ Reasons 

Identify few questions about your data that you would like to address. 
Reasons that motivated you to select your data

What powerball numbers were chosen the most?

What is day do people win most on?

Most popular powerplay?

Greatest Jackpot winings?



# Packages

List and Load all packages that will be used in your project and include one line comment explaining the nature of the list.
For example: (dplyr: to wrangle and manipulate data)

```{r}
library(dplyr) #this package is used for data manipulation
library(maps) # this package to draw maps
```

# reading the data

rd = read.csv("C:/Users/LiamL/Downloads/2022 Fall Data Challenge Dataset.xlsx - curated 2019-required.csv")


include a chunk to read the data and names

# Data Wrangling


Clean and label and prepare your data
Show the size of the data
numbers of rows and columns
classes of columns, how many `NA`?
Print out few lines
Rename variables of interest if their original name is long
Any substetting?
