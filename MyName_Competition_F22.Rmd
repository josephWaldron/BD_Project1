# Introduction to Mydata

Information collected from various sources. Include images if possible.

Example: 
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Boxplot Diagram", out.width = '75%',fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("week9\\my_project_Competition_f22\\samplegraph.png")
```

another example using snipe

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Snipe Example", out.width = '90%',fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("week9\\my_project_Competition_f22\\homepage.png")
```

## Link to your data

Data webpage:  <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/e0f1c0864a8e70d1640c14acf06ae4980b29811e0a68812447fe417b753f9eb3?resource=download> 

## Questions/ Reasons 

Identify few questions about your data that you would like to address. 
Reasons that motivated you to select your data
1. What powerball numbers got chosen the most?
2. What the average jackpot?
3. What day do people win most on?
4. What powerplay was most common?
5. What was the largest jackpot win?

# Packages

List and Load all packages that will be used in your project and include one line comment explaining the nature of the list.
For example: (dplyr: to wrangle and manipulate data)

```{r}
#library(dplyr) #this package is used for data manipulation
#library(maps) # this package to draw maps
library(knitr)
```

# reading the data

include a chunk to read the data and names
```{r}
raw_data <- read.csv("week9\\my_project_Competition_f22\\lottery_data.csv")
```

# Data Wrangling

Clean and label and prepare your data
Show the size of the data
numbers of rows and columns
classes of columns, how many `NA`?
Print out few lines
Rename variables of interest if their original name is long
Any substetting?

```{r}
#putting all values into variables
date <- raw_data$date
date <- as.Date(date)
weekday <- raw_data$weekday
winning_numbers <- raw_data$winning_numbers
powerball <- raw_data$powerball
powerplay <- raw_data$powerplay
options(scipen = 999)
jackpot <- raw_data$jackpot
head(jackpot)
cleaned_data <- data.frame(date = date,weekday = weekday, winning_numbers = winning_numbers,
powerball = powerball, powerplay = powerplay,jackpot = jackpot)
head(cleaned_data)
str(cleaned_data)
```

Include str and summary if possible

# Tables Frequency and proportions

# Visualizations of contengency tables or numerical variables

include variuous plots
Annotate your plots:title, label axes, nice colors.

# Statistical techniques
Test your hypothesis

# Conclusions

Highlight the information obtained from your project about the data.
Include some questions that you wish to investigate further.
